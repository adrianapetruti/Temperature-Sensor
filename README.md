# Temperature-Sensor
I created an electronic circuit for temperature measurement in a specified temperature domain. 
The circuit is provided with 4 light indicators(LEDs) which signals the exceeding of a set interval.
The LEDs are in different colors for every specified domain. The electrical resistence of the 
temperature traductor varies non-lineary with the temperature.
